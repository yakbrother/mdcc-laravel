# Marx Dormoy Chess Club fake site

This is just a sample site for playing with Laravel packages. All the text is from Chat GPT and is completely fake (although I do live in the Marx Dormoy neighborhood and love chess).

Built with Laravel, Vue.js, and Inertia.js to create a Single Page Application (SPA).

Run the seeder to populate the blog:

```
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## Roadmap
 - Create dashboard for blog posts
 - Add event system and calendar
 - Play more with Vue transitions and animations
 - Wrap in Docker
