# Marx Dormoy Chess Club fake site

![mdcc-screenshot-1](https://github.com/yakbrother/mdcc-laravel/assets/165183/6f90e64e-bd75-4117-b155-7a931c341c8e)

This is just a sample site for playing with Laravel packages. All the text is from Chat GPT and is completely fake (although I do live in the Marx Dormoy neighborhood and love chess).

Built with Laravel, Vue.js, and Inertia.js to create a Single Page Application (SPA).

Run the seeder to populate the blog:

```
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## Roadmap
 - Create dashboard for blog posts
 - Add event system and calendar
 - Play more with Vue transitions and animations
 - Wrap in Docker
