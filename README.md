 Marx Dormoy Chess Club site on Laravel

This is just a sample site for playing with Laravel packages. All the text is from Chat GPT and is completely fake (although I do live in the Marx Dormoy neighborhood and love chess).

Built with Laravel, Vue.js, and Inertia.js.

Run a maker in tinker to populate the blog:

```
\App\Models\BlogPost::factory()->times(10)->create();
```
